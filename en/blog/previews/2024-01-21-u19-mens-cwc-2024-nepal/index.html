Here is a brief overview of the players in the squad. Wishing them all the best for the tournament!</p><p>In this thread üßµ, we&rsquo;ll introduce you to the 15 young talents representing Nepal at the U19 Cricket World Cup. Their passion and skills are set to make a mark on the global stage! #RisingStars #NepalU19 üåü</p><h3 id=115-dev-khanal-captain>(1/15). Dev Khanal (captain)</h3><p>Dev Khanal üèè is the dynamic captain leading Nepal&rsquo;s U19 Cricket Team this CWC. Born on May 29, 2005, in Butwal, Rupandehi District, Dev is a tall right-handed explosive batsman and a handy offbreak bowler.</p><p>Coming up the ranks in Lumbini province and making his ODI debut against PNG in March 2022, Dev&rsquo;s journey symbolizes dedication and passion. He is one of two players who have played for the senior Nepal Men‚Äôs Cricket Team.</p><p>Dev comes into this tournament with scintillating batting displays during the ACC U19 Premier Cup and the WC Qualifiers campaigns. While he had an underwhelming U19 Asia Cup campaign, he is the mainstay of this batting lineup and will need to lead the aggression during the middle overs from a #4 position.</p><p>His tall frame and long levers along with a sound technique make him a strong player down the ground and an excellent player of spin. He is also a handy part-time bowler who utilises his height to his advantage.</p><p>As he leads Nepal after an 8-year hiatus in U19 World Cup, his performances and captaincy will be key to defining Nepal‚Äôs WC campaign. Let‚Äôs support him in making a mark on the global stage! #DevKhanal #NepalCricket #U19CWC</p><h3 id=215-gulshan-jha>(2/15). Gulshan Jha</h3><p>Gulshan Jha is another standout player in Nepal&rsquo;s U19 cricket squad. Born on February 17, 2006, in Sarlahi, this 17-year-old right-arm medium-fast bowler has already made a name for himself with his remarkable performances for the senior national team. #GulshanJha #NepalCricket #FutureStars üèèüá≥üáµ</p><p>Known for his fierce bouncers, Gulshan made his ODI debut at just 15, becoming the third youngest ODI player globally. With consistently good all-round performances in his short yet glistering, he&rsquo;s a rising star in Nepali cricket. #GulshanJha #NepalCricket #FutureStars üèèüá≥üáµ</p><p>In the tournament, Gulshan will likely be trusted to open the bowling. His tall stature and a knack for bowling into the wicket will make him one of the greatest threats for opposition batsmen in South African pitches.</p><p>He is a proper allrounder and thus will be relied heavily with the bat as well. His left-handedness will be key to the team maintaining a right hand-left hand combination in the center and guiding the team during the middle overs.</p><p>He will likely come in at #5 or #6. While he has a good defensive game, he is a naturally counter-attacking batsman who is not shy going after anything that is pitched up. His tall stature allows him to use his long levers to slog sweep spinners over cow corner.</p><p>Nepal will want Gulshan to be at his absolute best in all departments to leave a big mark in this tournament. He certainly has the skill, mindset, and experience to shine in this stage. We wish him all the best. #GulshanJha #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><h3 id=315-dipesh-kandel>(3/15). Dipesh Kandel</h3><p>Another stalwart of this team, Dipesh Kandel is a left-handed bowling allrounder who has consistently put in defining performances for the team. Short in stature, his records and repertoire are anything but. #DipeshKandel #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>His slow left-arm orthodox bowling is defined by pinpoint accuracy and exquisite control. He has a mean arm ball that is deathly to right-hand batsmen. He is also a decent batsman who puts a price on his wickets and emphasizes rotation of strike.</p><p>His hat-trick against the UAE in the final WC qualifiers game brought Nepal back to the WC after an 8-year hiatus. He was also the POTS in the ACC U19 Premier Cup after snagging 18 wickets in 5 games. His penchant for performing in the big game will be crucial in Nepal‚Äôs WC campaign.</p><p>He will likely operate in the middle overs to tighten up the scoring rate and to break partnerships. He will likely bat at #7 or #8 to provide a strong finish to the batting innings. We wish him another tremendous international campaign. #DipeshKandel #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Will be back with the rest of the team before the opening game tomorrow. All the best to the Nepali team for this WC campaign.</p><p>If you have any personal tidbits about these Nepalese players, please feel free to share!</p><h3 id=415-arjun-kumal>(4/15). Arjun Kumal</h3><p>Arjun Kumal is a standout opening batsman for Nepal&rsquo;s U19 cricket team. Born on December 11, 2005, in Gulmi, this 18-year-old right-hand batsman is known for his technical proficiency and composure at the crease. #ArjunKumal #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Of lean build, Arjun‚Äôs batting is built on a solid defensive foundation with a precocious ability to play classic cricketing shots on both sides of the wicket. He will be trusted to provide good starts for the team and capitalize on the first powerplay.</p><p>Arjun has shown his ability to score big, as evidenced by his sensational century against Saudi Arabia U19 in the ACC U19 Premier Cup, where he scored 143 runs from 111 balls. His 91 off 108 balls against Afghanistan during the U19 Asia Cup almost singlehandedly kept Nepal on the hunt in that match as well.</p><p>Arjun&rsquo;s style is marked by a blend of patience and aggression, making him a crucial player in Nepal&rsquo;s lineup for the U19 World Cup. Here is wishing that we will get to see every stroke in his arsenal in this tournament. #ArjunKumal #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=515-aakash-tripathi>(5/15). Aakash Tripathi</h3><p>Aakash Tripathi, an 18-year-old right-hand batsman from Rupandehi, is a dynamic and aggressive top-order batsman for the team, with the flexibility of playing down the order. He also bowls right-hand medium pacers as needed. #AakashTripathi #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>He was instrumental in Nepal&rsquo;s nine-wicket victory over Hong Kong at the Asian Regional Qualifier for the ICC U-19 Men&rsquo;s Cricket World Cup. Aakash scored an unbeaten 64 runs off 72 balls, displaying his ability to score quickly and build substantial innings.</p><p>His aggressive batting style and ability to take on the bowling attack have been highlighted in numerous matches, making him a key figure for Nepal in setting up big totals or chasing down targets. His medium pacers might be called up in South African pitches, as he is one of only 4 well known pacers in the team.</p><p>Aakash&rsquo;s performance in the U19 Asia Cup and other youth tournaments underscores his potential as a future star for Nepal cricket. We wish to see more consistent allround performances from him in this tournament.<br>#AakashTripathi #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=615-bipin-rawal>(6/15). Bipin Rawal</h3><p>19-year-old Bipin Rawal is a wicketkeeper and left-hand opening batsman. Born on September 25, 2004, in Kailali, he has represented major teams including Karnali Province and Pokhara Rhinos in the domestic circuit. #BipinRawal #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Bipin brings a combination of proficient wicket-keeping and a positive batting approach to the team. His left-handed batting adds variety to Nepal&rsquo;s lineup. As a wicketkeeper, Bipin has shown his skill behind the stumps, providing stability and assurance in the field.</p><p>In recent times, he has not been a regular in the U19 side but he featured in the recent U19 Asia Cup with middling returns that belie his batting ability and experience. He might have to compete with Deepak Prasad Dumre for a place in the playing 11 in the tournament.</p><p>Bipin has played in the domestic circuit long enough to show his quality as a batsman and a wicketkeeper. We wish him all the best to shine in this tournament any chance he gets!<br>#BipinRawal #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=715-durgesh-gupta>(7/15). Durgesh Gupta</h3><p>Durgesh Gupta is a 19-year-old left-arm medium-fast bowler who has represented Lumbini province and other major domestic teams. Although he hits the deck with the ball, he also can swing the ball and maintain a good line and length, making him an essential asset in Nepal&rsquo;s bowling attack. #BipinRawal #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Durgesh had an excellent ACC U19 Premier Cup tournament even though he did not feature in all of Nepal‚Äôs games. He narrowly missed out on the U19 Asia Cup squad last month, but is back in the side as the only left-arm pacer in the side, which highlights his key role in the tournament.He is also decent with the bat and has put up the rearguard fight in many domestic games.</p><p>Nepal will hope that Durgesh can prise out early wickets with the new ball and keep the scoring tight. His performance will be key in putting early pressure on the opponents and we wish him all the best for the tournament. #DurgeshGupta #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=815-uttam-ranju-thapa-magar>(8/15). Uttam Ranju Thapa Magar</h3><p>Uttam Ranju Thapa Magar, an 18-year-old wicketkeeper and right-hand batsman from Arghakhanchi, is a key middle-order batsman in the team with a knack for steadying the batting innings. #UttamThapaMagar #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><p>He was one of Nepal‚Äôs top performers in the U19 Asia Cup where he showed the temperament and composure to build his innings under pressure situations. He has plenty of experience batting together with both top- and lower-order batsmen to stitch up key batting partnerships.</p><p>Although he can also keep wickets, Uttam will likely be a backup keeper this tournament. Hence, his major role for the team will be to contribute crucial runs in the middle order and bat during the middle overs.</p><p>His ability to maintain composure under pressure in the middle order adds depth to the Nepal U19 team. We hope to see his best batting in this tournament.<br>#UttamRanjuThapaMagar #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=915-dipak-prasad-dumre>(9/15). Dipak Prasad Dumre</h3><p>Dipak Prasad Dumre is a 19-year-old right-hand aggressive middle-order wicketkeeper-batsman for Nepal&rsquo;s U19 cricket team. He also features for Gandaki province in Nepal‚Äôs domestic tournaments. #DipakPrasadDumre #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Dipak will likely compete with Bipin for a place in the starting 11. He offers reliable wicketkeeping skills along with the promise of providing a strong finish to the batting innings. He also has plenty of experience batting with the lower order.</p><p>Dipak has found himself in and out of the side in recent times but his potential is indubitable. He has contributed well with the bat during the preparatory warm-up games before the tournament and will hope to continue that throughout.</p><p>Dipak&rsquo;s keeping and explosive batting will be key in ensuring a strong finish to the batting innings. We hope to see him play fearlessly and sparkle during this tournament. #DipakPrasadDumre #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=1015-tilak-raj-bhandari>(10/15). Tilak Raj Bhandari</h3><p>Tilak Raj Bhandari is a 19-year-old right-arm leg-break bowler who has already made his mark in many domestic tournaments. He turns up for Bagmati province. #TilakRajBhandari #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>As with most wrist-spinners, Tilak has the ability to deceive batsmen with his variations, which brings him many wickets but he can sometimes prove expensive. He has a good slider in his arsenal that troubles the inside edge of right-hand batsmen.</p><p>While East London is known for wickets that aid fast bowlers, Tilak can yet contribute majorly to Nepal‚Äôs bowling with his variations and clever use of the long boundaries. Being the only wrist-spinner in the Nepal side, Tilak offers a unique wicket-taking bowling option for the team.</p><p>Tilak has consistently taken wickets at any level that he has played. Nepal will hope that he backs his skills and operates with good control throughout the tournament to become a major wicket-taking option for the team. #TilakRajBhandari #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=1115-dipak-bohara>(11/15). Dipak Bohara</h3><p>Dipak Bohara is a 19-year-old right-hand wicketkeeper-batsman from Baitadi.<br>He also represents SudurPaschim province in domestic tournaments. #DipakBohara #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Dipak is unlikely to be called upon for wicketkeeping duties in this tournament as he is one of four players who can perform the role. He is a naturally aggressive player who operates in the middle order. His best performances have come in the 20-over format but is a valuable member of this 50-over side as well.</p><p>He will need to perform the anchor role when called upon and hence needs to bat in a measured, composed way consistently to fulfill that role for the side. Here is wishing him all the best for this tournament! #DipakBohara #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=1215-deepak-bohara>(12/15). Deepak Bohara</h3><p>Deepak Bohara is an 18-year-old right-hand batsman and right-arm offbreak bowler from Dadeldhura. He also plays from Sudurpashchim Province like his namesake above. #DeepakBohara #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Deepak is a top order batsman who has often opened the innings for his team. He is a proactive player who can utilise the powerplay restrictions to Nepal‚Äôs favour. He has played in every position in the top order and has been an integral part of this squad over the years.</p><p>Deepak also bowls right-arm offbreaks with a springy action. He has been called upon to open the bowling for his province side in domestic tournaments. While that will be a luxury to call upon for the captain, his main role in the team will be to provide good batting starts.</p><p>After a slim showing in the U19 Asia Cup and the competition for places in the top- and middle order, Deepak might not be a guaranteed starter for this team. However, his ability to open the innings and provide a bowling option is valuable for the team. #DeepakBohara #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=1315-bishal-bikram-kc>(13/15). Bishal Bikram KC</h3><p>Bishal Bikram KC is an 18-year-old right-handed batter and right-arm offbreak bowler from Bardiya. He has played in many domestic tournaments and turns up for Lumbini province. #BishalBikramKC #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>In the U19 team, Bishal has mostly played in the middle order. He likes scoring runs square of the wicket and is a busy player who can shift gears in an innings. He also bowls off-breaks and can extract bounce from the pitch due to his tall frame and straight-arm action.</p><p>He is a former captain of the U16 side and has also been with the U19 squad for a couple of years and has participated in many international tournaments. He also featured against Pak U19 in U19 Asia Cup but struggled to perform there.</p><p>He adds to the depth of the middle order batsmen and the off-break bowling option for the team. Due to there being a few players with a similar skillset, there is a strong competition for his preferred place in the team. We wish him the best in this tournament and hope to see the best from him!<br>#BishalBikramKC #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=1415-subash-bhandari>(14/15). Subash Bhandari</h3><p>Subash Bhandari is a 19-year-old right-arm offbreak bowler from Baglung. He has represented Gandaki Province in domestic tournaments. #SubashBhandari #NepalCricket #FutureStars</p><p>Subash is the sole frontline off-spinner of the squad among other part-time options. He bowls tidy spells along tight lines exhibiting superb control of the art of bowling. While he is not a huge turner of the bowl, his discipline keeps the batsmen honest and his variation that skids through regularly tests their bat edges.</p><p>He has formed a formidable bowling partnership with Dipesh in the middle overs in the last year and can always be trusted to hold an end keeping things tight. He performed impressively during the WC qualifiers and the ACC U19 Premier Cup, and had a decent outing in the U19 Asia Cup.</p><p>Given the nature of wickets in SA that favors pacers, there might be a toss up in team selection between him and Tilak. But Nepal know from experience that they can also rely on him to keep things simple, tight, and tidy against any opposition.</p><p>Subash will be relied on applying pressure and taking crucial wickets, especially in the middle overs. He has the experience and skillset to test any opposition. We wish him all the best in this tournament. #SubashBhandari #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p><h3 id=1515-akash-chand>(15/15). Akash Chand</h3><p>Akash Chand is a 19-year-old right-arm medium bowler from Kanchanpur, who turns up for Sudurpaschim province. He will be expected to play a key role in this tournament as a strike bowler in pace-friendly wickets. #AkashChand #NepalCricket #U19CWC</p><p>His bowling partner in the province and U19 level, Hemant Dhami, misses out on this tournament due to injury. While Akash will surely miss his fellow pacer and friend, he will be ever more determined to perform in this tournament.</p><p>Akash generally bowls first change and during the death overs. He can also be called upon in the middle to inject aggression and break partnerships during the middle overs. He hits the deck hard and relies on good bounce and seam movement. As such, he will likely have a huge part to play in this tournament.</p><p>In the national U19 level, Akash has also chipped in with key contributions with the bat from time to time. His natural game is to go after the bowling attack but he can also be relied on to hold on to his wicket.</p><p>Nepal will need Akash to provide able support to the opening bowlers, show control alongside aggression, and execute their bowling plans in the death overs. His good form is a must if Nepal are to have a huge tournament.<br>#AkashChand #NepalCricket #U19CWC üèèüá≥üáµ</p></article><div class="px-2 mb-2"><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo data-repo-id data-category data-category-id data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=preferred_color_scheme data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="container px-4 py-12 mx-auto max-w-4xl grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 items-center"><div><div class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Follow me</div><p class=opacity-60>I write blog posts here and tweet about cricket on X.</p></div><ul class="flex justify-center gap-x-3 flex-wrap gap-y-2"><li><a href=https://twitter.com/cricketpremee target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label=Twitter class="p-1 inline-block rounded-full border border-transparent text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-800 hover:border-gray-800 cursor-pointer transition-colors dark:text-gray-600 dark:hover:border-gray-300 dark:hover:text-gray-300"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M22 4.01c-1 .49-1.98.689-3 .99-1.121-1.265-2.783-1.335-4.38-.737S11.977 6.323 12 8v1c-3.245.083-6.135-1.395-8-4 0 0-4.182 7.433 4 11-1.872 1.247-3.739 2.088-6 2 3.308 1.803 6.913 2.423 10.034 1.517 3.58-1.04 6.522-3.723 7.651-7.742a13.84 13.84.0 00.497-3.753C20.18 7.773 21.692 5.25 22 4.009z"/></svg></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class="container p-6 mx-auto flex justify-between items-center"><span class="text-sm font-light">Copyright ¬© 2024 - Cricket Premee ¬∑ All rights reserved
