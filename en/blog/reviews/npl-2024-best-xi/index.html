After much deliberation, here’s our <strong>Best Overall XI</strong>, featuring players who excelled with their consistent displays throughout the tournament.</p><p><strong>Key criteria</strong> for selection:</p><ul><li>A fieldable team with a good ratio of batsmen, bowlers, , all-rounders, and a wicketkeeper.</li><li>No restrictions on the number of overseas players (check out <a href=#best-fieldable-xi-of-npl-202425>the Best Fieldable XI</a>
for the best XI team with 4 overseas players).</li></ul><hr><h3 id=overall-best-xi>Overall Best XI</h3><h4 id=1-lahiru-milantha-openerwicketkeeper-janakpur-bolts-overseas><strong>1. Lahiru Milantha (Opener/Wicketkeeper, Janakpur Bolts, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 293 runs in 10 innings, Avg 32.55, SR 130.80, HS 87</li></ul><p>Milantha ended the tournament as the top run scorer but his path through the tournament had peaks and troughs. He started the tournament with a bang, scoring an unbeaten 75 against the Kings. His performances trended downwards after that but he came back strong in the final with a match-winning 87 off 49 balls. As such, he narrowly edges out Andries Gous for the opener&rsquo;s spot in this Best XI with the weight of his performances in the final for a winning cause for the Bolts.</p><hr><h4 id=2-saif-zaib-top-order-sudur-paschim-royals-overseas><strong>2. Saif Zaib (Top Order, Sudur Paschim Royals, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 275 runs in 9 innings, Avg 30.55, SR 136.13, HS 90</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 12 wickets in 9 innings, Avg 12.58, Econ 6.24, Best 3/33</li></ul><p>Zaib has been a reliable presence in this Royals side, providing stability at the top of the order while also providing a reliable bowling option for his captain. In many ways, he has outshone the other top-order allrounder in the team, Brandon McMullen, with his performances. He has stitched together some crucial partnerships with Binod Bhandari at the top of the Royals&rsquo; batting order while proving his mettle as another handy left-arm spin option making him a complete package in this format of the game.</p><p>He led the Royals&rsquo; batting efforts in the final scoring a brisk 69 off 43 balls and stitched together a 100+ runs partnership with Bhandari to provide a solid foundation for the Royals&rsquo; batting in what ended up being a losing cause. He contributed with the ball as well, picking up the crucial wicket of the Bolts&rsquo; captain, Aasif Sheikh and conceding just 14 runs in his 3 overs.</p><p>He was awarded the Player of the Tournament award for his all-round performances and walks into this Best XI as a no-brainer.</p><hr><h4 id=3-rohit-paudel-top-orderoff-spin-lumbini-lions-marquee><strong>3. Rohit Paudel (Top Order/Off-spin, Lumbini Lions, marquee)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 279 runs in 7 innings, Avg 39.85, SR 131.60, HS 95</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 8 wickets in 6 innings, Avg 13.37, Econ 5.63, Best 4/17</li></ul><p>In an otherwise forgettable season for the Lions, Rohit Paudel was a shining, nay, a blazing light. The young captain led from the front with ball, bat, and in the field. He scored 80 off 57 balls and recorded bowling figures of 4/17 to give the Lions their only win of the season against the Rhinos. He did it all &ndash; alone. But cricket is a team sport and the lack of support from his teammates meant that the Lions finished at the bottom of the table in the inaugural season of the NPL. However, he walks into this Best XI with his head held high.</p><hr><h4 id=4-ravi-bopara-middle-order-chitwan-rhinos-overseas><strong>4. Ravi Bopara (Middle Order, Chitwan Rhinos, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 286 runs in 8 innings, Avg 40.85, SR 135.54, HS 59*</li></ul><p>There was some pre-season chatter about the Rhinos&rsquo; decision to draft the veteran Ravi Bopara into their team. But the English all-rounder silenced his critics with a string of consistent performances. The all-rounder brought his wealth of experience to the Rhinos, anchoring their innings and finishing games with finesse. His three fifties were crucial in steering the Rhinos to victories in the group stages.</p><p>Perhaps more valuable was his mentorship. Rhinos had the youngest captain in the tournament in Kushal Malla and Bopara&rsquo;s guidance was instrumental in helping Malla lead the team in the tournament. Bopara&rsquo;s all-round contributions with bat and ball were crucial to the Rhinos&rsquo; success in what some considered a surprise run to the playoff spot.</p><hr><h4 id=5-jimmy-neesham-middle-ordermedium-pace-janakpur-bolts-overseas><strong>5. Jimmy Neesham (Middle Order/Medium Pace, Janakpur Bolts, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 247 runs in 9 innings, Avg 35.28, SR 196.03, HS 65</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 7 wickets in 9 innings, Avg 33.28, Econ 8.96, Best 2/29</li></ul><p>Jimmy Neesham probably started a bit slow in the tournament but his last four innings prior to the final have been something to behold. He comfortably has the highest strike rate in the tournament and has scored 200+ runs with that strike rate. He has hit the most sixes and has the highest boundary percentage in the tournament. He won the Energetic Player of the Tournament award for his performances.</p><p>These figures might not be surprising to those who have followed Neesham&rsquo;s career. He has always been a fearless hitter of the cricket ball who wears his heart on his sleeve. Even throughout the tournament, he has been a vocal presence on the field, unafraid to show his emotions and frustrations.</p><p>His performances have increasingly become more important for the Bolts&rsquo; winning campaign. And while he might not have stolen the limelight in the final, it is no surprise that he has been included in this Best XI.</p><hr><h4 id=6-dipendra-singh-airee-all-rounder-sudur-paschim-royals-marquee><strong>6. Dipendra Singh Airee (All-rounder, Sudur Paschim Royals, marquee)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 227 runs in 9 innings, Avg 37.83, SR 160.99, HS 57*</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 9 wickets in 9 innings, Avg 19.44, Econ 7.00, Best 3/29</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 7 runouts.</li></ul><p>It was written in fate that Airee would be drawn as a marquee player for the Royals &ndash; his home province. And what a teamup it has been.</p><p>No one gets as loud a cheer in Nepal as Dipendra Singh Airee when he walks out on to the field. He is a crowd favorite and it is easy to see why. He is dynamic in the field, is a reliable spin-bowling option available even for the death overs, and a powerful middle-order batsman who can change the course of a game in a matter of overs. And he has delivered on all fronts in the inaugural season of the NPL.</p><p>His captaincy also has generally been on point (aside from team selection in a few games but we won&rsquo;t hold that against him). He has had the fortune of some outstanding performances from his teammates in a strong Royals side but he has truly led from the front in the campaign sculpting some of the most dominant wins in the tournament.</p><p>While the Royals&rsquo; fell short in the final, Airee bagged home the Nepali Player of the Tournament award with the much coveted Omoda electric car as a prize. He walks into this Best XI as a no-brainer.</p><hr><h4 id=7-william-bosisto-all-rounder-karnali-yaks-overseas><strong>7. William Bosisto (All-rounder, Karnali Yaks, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 194 runs in 7 innings, Avg 38.80, SR 119.01, HS 66</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 9 wickets, Econ 6.83, Best 6/28</li></ul><p>Who would have thought that 12 years since the U19 World Cup 2012, the captains of the two finalists in the tournament, India and Australia, would be playing in the same T20 league in Nepal? But here we are. Unmukt Chand and William Bosisto are both here, but with starkly different fortunes in the tournament. While Bosisto features in this Best XI, Chand features in the <a href=https://cricketpremee.github.io/en/blog/reviews/2024-12-20-npl-s1-underwhelmingxi/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Underwhelming XI</a>
of the tournament.</p><p>Bosisto has been a revelation for the Yaks. He has been their highest run-scorer in the tournament and holds the tournament&rsquo;s best bowling figures as well. He has fielded well, memorably effecting a runout from the deep in his first game as a substitute fielder just hours after landing in Nepal.</p><p>He has perhaps not had the career that one expects from an Australian U19 captain but perhaps this tournament is the start of a new chapter in his career?</p><hr><h4 id=8-scott-kuggeleijn-medium-fast-sudur-paschim-royals-overseas><strong>8. Scott Kuggeleijn (Medium Fast, Sudur Paschim Royals, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 17 wickets in 9 innings , Avg 12.35, Econ 7.28, Best 5/18</li></ul><p>Kuggeleijn finishes as the tournament&rsquo;s joint-leading wicket-taker and was a regular fixture in the Royals&rsquo; playing XI. He perhaps started a little under the radar in the tournament even though he was prising out early top-order wickets since Game 1. His tall frame, springy action, and hit the deck hard style of bowling has been a challenge for the batsmen all tournament. In a tournament largely dominated by spinners, Kuggeleijn has been a vital pace option for the Royals and a huge part of their impressive campaign.</p><p>While he was not his usual self in the final, his contributions throughout the tournament with the ball and cameo knocks with the bat means that he finds a place in this Best XI.</p><hr><h4 id=9-sohail-tanvir-bowler-chitwan-rhinos-overseas><strong>9. Sohail Tanvir (Bowler, Chitwan Rhinos, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 14 wickets in 8 innings, Econ 5.73, Best 5/21</li></ul><p>It is 2024 and Sohail Tanvir is still taking wickets. He was a revelation in the first edition of the IPL back in 2008 and he is still revelling in this inaugural edition of the NPL in 2024. He ends the tournament as the third-highest wicket-taker overall and the highest wicket-taker for the Rhinos.</p><p>His partnership with Nepali left-arm pacer Rijan Dhakal was hugely productive for the Rhinos. They reduced the Avengers to a measly looking 7/6 early in the tournament and kept on reliably picking up early wickets throughout the tournament.</p><p>On top of that, Tanvir has been a great mentor to the young Nepali bowlers in the Rhinos&rsquo; squad. One can hope that Rijan has had a lot to learn from him throughout the tournament.</p><hr><h4 id=10-lalit-narayan-rajbanshi-bowler-janakpur-bolts><strong>10. Lalit Narayan Rajbanshi (Bowler, Janakpur Bolts)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 17 wickets in 10 innings, Avg 12.52, Econ 5.32, Best 3/8</li></ul><p>Lalit has truly worn the mantle of Nepal&rsquo;s premier spinner in the tournament. He is the tournament&rsquo;s joint highest wicket-taker with a sub-6 economy rate. He bowls in the powerplay overs and has been used occasionally in the death overs as well in the tournament.</p><p>While his contributions can be undervalued saying that the conditions have been spin-friendly, his control with the ball and his ability to consistently outfox the batsmen with drift, dip, and turn has been a sight to behold. He has been a key part of the Bolts&rsquo; campaign and has been instrumental in their journey to the final.</p><p>He put in one of his classic performances in the final, picking up the important wicket of Binod Bhandari and conceding just 15 runs in his 4 overs in a high-scoring final. He was awarded the Best Bowler of the Tournament award for his performances.</p><hr><h4 id=11-bipin-sharma-bowler-karnali-yaks-iconicuncapped><strong>11. Bipin Sharma (Bowler, Karnali Yaks, iconic/uncapped)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 13 wickets in 8 innings, Econ 5.89, Best 3/17</li></ul><p>Is age just a number? While players like Ravi Bopara and Sohail Tanvir are attempting to disprove that from the other end of the age spectrum, Bipin Sharma is doing that from the youth end. What a tournament he has had! He has prised the wickets of Gous, Neesham, Guptill, and many more big names in the tournament. He has been the Yaks&rsquo; go-to bowler in the powerplay yet has a sub-6 economy rate.</p><p>He has a great arm-ball that challenges the inside edge of the right-handers, but his greater asset might just be his confidence with the ball. This might well be known as the breakout season for Bipin Sharma in the coming years. He was awarded the Emerging Player of the Tournament.</p><hr><h3 id=honourable-mentions>Honourable Mentions</h3><h4 id=1-kushal-malla-chitwan-rhinos-marquee>1. <strong>Kushal Malla (Chitwan Rhinos, marquee):</strong></h4><p>Contributed with both bat and ball, and captained the Rhinos well to a playoff spot, potentially exceeding expectations.</p><h4 id=2-rijan-dhakal-chitwan-rhinos>2. <strong>Rijan Dhakal (Chitwan Rhinos):</strong></h4><p>Some of his opening spells in the tournament were enthraling to watch. He was a great partner to Sohail Tanvir for the Rhinos.</p><h4 id=3-andries-gous-pokhara-avengers>3. <strong>Andries Gous (Pokhara Avengers):</strong></h4><p>The tournament&rsquo;s only centurion, Gous was a such a key figure in the Avengers&rsquo; campaign that they always looked like winning when he was at the batting crease. He narrowly missed out on the opener&rsquo;s spot in the Best XI, owing to Milantha&rsquo;s match-winning innings in the final.</p><h4 id=4-harsh-thaker-janakpur-bolts>4. <strong>Harsh Thaker (Janakpur Bolts):</strong></h4><p>He has 100+ runs and 11 wickets in the tournament. He has 3 not-out knocks in the tournament leading his team home and has prised out some crucial wickets for the Bolts. He was one of the key stalwarts in the Bolts&rsquo; chase in the final.</p><h4 id=5-kishore-mahato-janakpur-bolts>5. <strong>Kishore Mahato (Janakpur Bolts):</strong></h4><p>Kishore has looked good with the new ball and has been reliable in the death too. He took 14 wickets in the tournament and his opening spells were a treat to watch due to his beautiful outswingers.</p><h4 id=6-gerhard-erasmus-kathmandu-gurkhas>6. <strong>Gerhard Erasmus (Kathmandu Gurkhas):</strong></h4><p>Erasmus provided crucial all-round contributions for the Gurkhas, amidst a challenging season for the team. He ended the tournament with 110 runs and 11 wickets. His batting was arguably more valuable as his top scores came in crucial wins for the Gurkhas.</p><h4 id=7-raymon-reifer-pokhara-avengers>7. <strong>Raymon Reifer (Pokhara Avengers):</strong></h4><p>Reifer was at the center-stage of perhaps the most thrilling game of the tournament &ndash; the super over win against the Kings. He smashed two sixes in the final over of the regulation play to take the game to the super over. Then he smacked 17 off 5 balls in the super over and defended by conceding only 4 runs. Perhaps that performance alone makes him worthy of a mention, but his contributions extended beyond that game.</p><h4 id=8-brandon-mcmullen-sudur-paschim-royals>8. <strong>Brandon McMullen (Sudur Paschim Royals):</strong></h4><p>A reliable top-order batsman and a handy medium-pacer, he has played a quiet but crucial role in the Royals&rsquo; campaign. He perhaps has been slightly overshadowed by Saif Zaib&rsquo;s performances in this tournament, but it is clear to see that he has the trust of his captain and his teammates to deliver in key moments.</p><p>These players were outstanding in their own right and were pivotal to their respective teams’ campaigns, narrowly missing out on the Best XI.</p><hr><p>Who made it to your Best XI? Let us know in the comments or on social media!</p><p>#NPL2024 #BestXI #CricketAnalysis</p><hr><p>While the above is the overall Best XI, we also have a <strong>Best Fieldable XI</strong> that adheres to the the additional team selection rule of allowing only 4 overseas players. Check that list out below!</p><h3 id=best-fieldable-xi-of-npl-202425>Best Fieldable XI of NPL 2024/25</h3><p>While the <strong>Best XI</strong> highlighted standout individual performances, the <strong>Best Fieldable XI</strong> adheres to team selection rules with a balanced and fieldable team structure. This lineup consists of 4 overseas players, a wicketkeeper, and a mix of batters, all-rounders, and bowlers to form a functional playing XI.</p><hr><h4 id=1-lahiru-milantha-openerwicketkeeper-janakpur-bolts-overseas-1><strong>1. Lahiru Milantha (Opener/Wicketkeeper, Janakpur Bolts, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 293 runs in 10 innings, Avg 32.55, SR 130.80, HS 87</li></ul><p>Milantha ended the tournament as the top run scorer but his path through the tournament had peaks and troughs. He started the tournament with a bang, scoring an unbeaten 75 against the Kings. His performances trended downwards after that but he came back strong in the final with a match-winning 87 off 49 balls. As such, he narrowly edges out Andries Gous for the opener&rsquo;s spot in this Best XI with the weight of his performances in the final for a winning cause for the Bolts.</p><hr><h4 id=2-binod-bhandari-top-orderwicketkeeper-sudur-paschim-royals><strong>2. Binod Bhandari (Top Order/Wicketkeeper, Sudur Paschim Royals)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 235 runs in 9 innings, Avg 33.57, SR 111.37, HS 58*</li></ul><p>Another domestic tournament in which Bhandari shines with the bat. That has probably been the most common occurence in Nepali cricket in the last decade.</p><p>He has forged a strong partnership with Saif Zaib at the top of the order for the Royals. He has both played the aggressor and the anchor role in the tournament to great effect.</p><p>This might anyways have been a memorable tournament for Bhandari as he was able to don a yellow jersey with the number 7 on the back &ndash; reminiscent of the look of his idol, MS Dhoni in the IPL. But his batting, wicketkeeping, and leadership have all stood out in this tournament.</p><p>He gave the Royals a blistering start in the final helping them plunder 17 runs off the first over. He forged a 100+ runs first-wicket partnership with Zaib that firmly put the Royals in the driver&rsquo;s seat in the final.</p><hr><h4 id=3-rohit-paudel-top-orderoff-spin-lumbini-lions-marquee-1><strong>3. Rohit Paudel (Top Order/Off-spin, Lumbini Lions, marquee)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 279 runs in 7 innings, Avg 39.85, SR 131.60, HS 95</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 8 wickets in 6 innings, Avg 13.37, Econ 5.63, Best 4/17</li></ul><p>In an otherwise forgettable season for the Lions, Rohit Paudel was a shining, nay, a blazing light. The young captain led from the front with ball, bat, and in the field. He scored 80 off 57 balls and recorded bowling figures of 4/17 to give the Lions their only win of the season against the Rhinos. He did it all &ndash; alone. But cricket is a team sport and the lack of support from his teammates meant that the Lions finished at the bottom of the table in the inaugural season of the NPL. However, he walks into this Best XI with his head held high.</p><hr><h4 id=4-ravi-bopara-middle-order-chitwan-rhinos-overseas-1><strong>4. Ravi Bopara (Middle Order, Chitwan Rhinos, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 286 runs in 8 innings, Avg 40.85, SR 135.54, HS 59*</li></ul><p>There was some pre-season chatter about the Rhinos&rsquo; decision to draft Ravi Bopara into their team. But the English all-rounder silenced his critics with a string of consistent performances. The veteran all-rounder brought his wealth of experience to the Rhinos, anchoring their innings and finishing games with finesse. His three fifties were crucial in steering the Rhinos through the tournament.</p><p>More valuable was his mentorship. Rhinos had the youngest captain in the tournament in Kushal Malla and Bopara&rsquo;s guidance was instrumental in helping Malla lead the team to the final. Bopara&rsquo;s all-round contributions with bat and ball were crucial to the Rhinos&rsquo; success in what many considered a surprise run to the playoff spot.</p><hr><h4 id=5-kushal-malla-middle-order-chitwan-rhinos-marquee><strong>5. Kushal Malla (Middle Order, Chitwan Rhinos, marquee)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 223 runs in 8 innings, Avg 27.87, SR 121.19, HS 72</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 9 wickets, Econ 6.51, Best 2/18</li></ul><p>Kushal Malla is another name that consistently pops up in the Best XI discussions in domestic tournaments in Nepal. His left-handed batting combined with his aggressive strokeplay is always an asset to any team here in Nepal. He supplements that with his canny slow left-arm orthodox bowling to great effect as well.</p><p>This is a breakout tournament of sorts for Malla as he embarked on his first major senior tournament as a captain. He gave a good account of himself with his captaincy and the Rhinos&rsquo; campaign often looked like the most relaxed one out in the field &ndash; perhaps a testament to his leadership.</p><hr><h4 id=6-dipendra-singh-airee-all-rounder-sudur-paschim-royals-marquee-1><strong>6. Dipendra Singh Airee (All-rounder, Sudur Paschim Royals, marquee)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 227 runs in 9 innings, Avg 37.83, SR 160.99, HS 57*</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 9 wickets in 9 innings, Avg 19.44, Econ 7.00, Best 3/29</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 7 runouts.</li></ul><p>It was written in fate that Airee would be drawn as a marquee player for the Royals &ndash; his home province. And what a teamup it has been.</p><p>No one gets as loud a cheer in Nepal as Dipendra Singh Airee when he walks out on to the field. He is a crowd favorite and it is easy to see why. He is dynamic in the field, is a reliable spin-bowling option available even for the death overs, and a powerful middle-order batsman who can change the course of a game in a matter of overs. And he has delivered on all fronts in the inaugural season of the NPL.</p><p>His captaincy also has generally been on point (aside from team selection in a few games but we won&rsquo;t hold that against him). He has had the fortune of some outstanding performances from his teammates in a strong Royals side but he has truly led from the front in the campaign sculpting some of the most dominant wins in the tournament.</p><p>While the Royals&rsquo; fell short in the final, Airee bagged home the Nepali Player of the Tournament award with the much coveted Omoda electric car as a prize. He walks into this Best XI as a no-brainer.</p><hr><h4 id=7-jimmy-neesham-middle-ordermedium-pace-janakpur-bolts-overseas><strong>7. Jimmy Neesham (Middle Order/Medium Pace, Janakpur Bolts, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 247 runs in 9 innings, Avg 35.28, SR 196.03, HS 65</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 7 wickets in 9 innings, Avg 33.28, Econ 8.96, Best 2/29</li></ul><p>Jimmy Neesham probably started a bit slow in the tournament but his last four innings prior to the final have been something to behold. He comfortably has the highest strike rate in the tournament and has scored 200+ runs with that strike rate. He has hit the most sixes and has the highest boundary percentage in the tournament. He won the Energetic Player of the Tournament award for his performances.</p><p>These figures might not be surprising to those who have followed Neesham&rsquo;s career. He has always been a fearless hitter of the cricket ball who wears his heart on his sleeve. Even throughout the tournament, he has been a vocal presence on the field, unafraid to show his emotions and frustrations.</p><p>His performances have increasingly become more important for the Bolts&rsquo; winning campaign. And while he might not have stolen the limelight in the final, it is no surprise that he has been included in this Best XI.</p><hr><h4 id=8-scott-kuggeleijn-medium-fast-sudur-paschim-royals-overseas-1><strong>8. Scott Kuggeleijn (Medium Fast, Sudur Paschim Royals, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 17 wickets in 9 innings , Avg 12.35, Econ 7.28, Best 5/18</li></ul><p>Kuggeleijn finishes as the tournament&rsquo;s joint-leading wicket-taker and was a regular fixture in the Royals&rsquo; playing XI. He perhaps started a little under the radar in the tournament even though he was prising out early top-order wickets since Game 1. His tall frame, springy action, and hit the deck hard style of bowling has been a challenge for the batsmen all tournament. In a tournament largely dominated by spinners, Kuggeleijn has been a vital pace option for the Royals and a huge part of their impressive campaign.</p><p>While he was not his usual self in the final, his contributions throughout the tournament with the ball and cameo knocks with the bat means that he finds a place in this Best XI.</p><hr><h4 id=9-rijan-dhakal-bowler-chitwan-rhinos><strong>9. Rijan Dhakal (Bowler, Chitwan Rhinos)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 13 wickets, Econ 8.04, Best 3/10</li></ul><p>Rijan Dhakal showed this tournament why the inswinging delivery to the right-handers is such a potent weapon in a left-arm pacer&rsquo;s arsenal. He used that delivery to devastating effect in the tournament and received international praise for it, notably from the likes of Irfan Pathan.</p><p>His partnership with Sohail Tanvir formed the backbone of the Rhinos&rsquo; campaign as they revelled in restricting the opposition to low totals in the powerplay.</p><p>While his death bowling needs more time to develop, he is perhaps the most difficult Nepali bowler to face in the powerplay overs at the moment. He will be hoping that his performances in the tournament will be enough to earn him an extended run in the national team as he continues to develop the other facets of his game.</p><hr><h4 id=10-bipin-sharma-bowler-karnali-yaks-iconicuncapped><strong>10. Bipin Sharma (Bowler, Karnali Yaks, iconic/uncapped)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 13 wickets in 8 innings, Econ 5.89, Best 3/17</li></ul><p>Is age just a number? While players like Ravi Bopara and Sohail Tanvir are attempting to disprove that from the other end of the age spectrum, Bipin Sharma is doing that from the youth end. What a tournament he has had! He has prised the wickets of Gous, Neesham, Guptill, and many more big names in the tournament. He has been the Yaks&rsquo; go-to bowler in the powerplay yet has a sub-6 economy rate.</p><p>He has a great arm-ball that challenges the inside edge of the right-handers, but his greater asset might just be his confidence with the ball. This might well be known as the breakout season for Bipin Sharma in the coming years. He was awarded the Emerging Player of the Tournament.</p><hr><h4 id=11-lalit-narayan-rajbanshi-bowler-janakpur-bolts><strong>11. Lalit Narayan Rajbanshi (Bowler, Janakpur Bolts)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 17 wickets in 10 innings, Avg 12.52, Econ 5.32, Best 3/8</li></ul><p>Lalit has truly worn the mantle of Nepal&rsquo;s premier spinner in the tournament. He is the tournament&rsquo;s joint highest wicket-taker with a sub-6 economy rate. He bowls in the powerplay overs and has been used occasionally in the death overs as well in the tournament.</p><p>While his contributions can be undervalued saying that the conditions have been spin-friendly, his control with the ball and his ability to consistently outfox the batsmen with drift, dip, and turn has been a sight to behold. He has been a key part of the Bolts&rsquo; campaign and has been instrumental in their journey to the final.</p><p>He put in one of his classic performances in the final, picking up the important wicket of Binod Bhandari and conceding just 15 runs in his 4 overs in a high-scoring final. He was awarded the Best Bowler of the Tournament award for his performances.</p><hr><p>Who would you have in your Best Fieldable XI?
