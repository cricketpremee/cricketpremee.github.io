Aashutosh Ghiraiya (Opener, Lumbini Lions, uncapped)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 44 runs in 6 innings, Avg 7.33, SR 62.85, HS 16</li></ul><p>Aashutosh Ghiraiya had a tough campaign for the Lumbini Lions in the NPL 2024/25. Known for his stellar domestic performances, especially in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Cup earlier this year, Ghiraiya struggled to find any kind of form in this tournament. His inability to provide solid starts as an opener left the Lions in a precarious position early in their innings. This disappointing performance was a far cry from the expectations set by the teams during the player draft as he was sold for the highest price for Category B players.</p><hr><h4 id=2-michael-levitt-openermedium-pacer-kathmandu-gurkhas-overseas><strong>2. Michael Levitt (Opener/medium-pacer, Kathmandu Gurkhas, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 102 runs in 7 innings, Avg 14.57, SR 137.83, HS 32</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 1 wicket in 2 innings, Avg 45.00, Econ 7.50</li></ul><p>Levitt is known as one of the most explosive batters in the associate circuit. He made his T20I debut in 2024 at the TU International Cricket Ground, Kathmandu in which the current NPL is being played. He scored a stellar half-century in his debut match against Nepal and ended up as the MotM in the final match of the series as well. Given his past exploits, the Gurkhas would have expected him to play a crucial role in their campaign with the bat but he largely failed to deliver in this edition. His part-time medium pace was used in a couple of matches but was nothing to write home about.</p><hr><h4 id=3-arjun-saud-top-orderwicketkeeper-lumbini-lions><strong>3. Arjun Saud (Top Order/Wicketkeeper, Lumbini Lions)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 68 runs in 6 innings, Avg 11.33, SR 95.77, HS 20</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 4 dismissals (1 catch, 3 stumpings)</li></ul><p>Arjun Saud was another player tasked with opening the batting for the Lions and providing them solid starts. Being a current international and a regular feature of the Nepal ODI squad, many hoped him to provide an anchor role in the Lions&rsquo; batting lineup in which to build around. However, he was guilty of getting out at crucial junctures and to largely innocuous deliveries in a few matches. While his wicketkeeping was decent, his batting was a major letdown for the Lions.</p><hr><h4 id=4-kushal-bhurtel-top-orderleg-spin-captain-pokhara-avengers-marquee><strong>4. Kushal Bhurtel (Top-order/Leg-spin, Captain, Pokhara Avengers, marquee)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 54 runs in 6 innings, Avg 9.00, SR 83.07</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 5 wickets in 6 innings, Avg 22.60, Econ 7.97</li><li><strong>Catches:</strong> 3 dismissals (3 catches)</li></ul><p>Kushal Bhurtel, the captain of the Pokhara Avengers, endured a dismal season in NPL 2024/25. Renowned for his aggressive batting at the top of the order, Bhurtel managed only 54 runs across six innings, with a disappointing average of 9.00. While he provided occasional breakthroughs with the ball, taking five wickets, his main role in the team is to provide runs at the top of the order.</p><p>There is no-one as stylish and destructive as Bhurtel when he is in full flow, but those sort of innings have recently been few and far between. Many might have tipped him to come good at the TU International Cricket Ground where he has had some memorable innings in the past but he massively failed to deliver this time around.</p><hr><h4 id=5-unmukt-chand-middle-order-lumbini-lions-overseas><strong>5. Unmukt Chand (Middle Order, Lumbini Lions, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 18 runs in 4 innings, Avg 4.50, SR 62.06, HS 14</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 2 dismissals (2 catches)</li></ul><p>Unmukt Chand, the former under-19 World Cup-winning captain, was one of the more exciting foreign picks in the NPL 2024/25. He was expected to follow Arjun and Aashutosh in the batting order and build partnerships with the Lions&rsquo; captain Rohit Paudel. But he looked at sea all through the tournament especially against frontline pacers. His poor form with the bat compounded the Lions&rsquo; batting woes at the top order and made for a forgettable season for both him and the Lions.</p><hr><h4 id=6-bhim-sharki-middle-order-kathmandu-gurkhas><strong>6. Bhim Sharki (Middle Order, Kathmandu Gurkhas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 78 runs in 7 innings, Avg 11.14, SR 79.59, HS 31</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 0 wickets in 3 innings, Econ 6.00</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 3 dismissals (3 catches)</li></ul><p>Bhim Sharki is another regular fixture in the national ODI squad who struggled to deliver in the NPL 2024/25. His trademark temperament and ability to play unconventional shots behind the wickets were largely missing in this edition. 4 out of his 7 innings ended in single-digit scores and he failed to provide stability in the middle order for the Gurkhas despite the Gurkhas&rsquo; shelling out the highest possible price for a Category A player for him and fielding him in all their matches.</p><p>His part-time offies were used in a few matches in which he bowled economically but failed to pick up any wickets.</p><hr><h4 id=7-ben-cutting-middle-order-lumbini-lions-overseas><strong>7. Ben Cutting (Middle-order, Lumbini Lions, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 10 runs in 3 innings, Avg 4.50, SR 62.06, HS 6</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 1 dismissal (1 catch)</li></ul><p>Ben Cutting, the former Australian all-rounder, was one of the most high-profile overseas picks in the NPL 2024/25. Known for his big-hitting ability, one might best remember his fiery batting performance against RCB in the IPL 2016 final to win the match for Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Lions&rsquo; management might have had that innings in mind when they drafted him for the Lions but he failed in each innings he played in this edition.</p><p>Moreover, his inability to bowl in recent times meant that he was rotated with Unmukt Chand as a middle-order batting option in the tournament and ended up playing only 3 matches.</p><hr><h4 id=8-michael-leask-all-rounder-pokhara-avengers-overseas><strong>8. Michael Leask (All-rounder, Pokhara Avengers, overseas)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 44 runs in 7 innings, Avg 7.33, SR 125.71, HS 25</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 3 wickets in 7 innings, Avg 52.00, Econ 7.09</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 0 catches</li></ul><p>Michael Leask, an experienced all-rounder from Scotland, has made his name as the finisher for the Scottish national team. He was expected to provide the Avengers with some firepower in the middle order and also chip in with his off-spinners. However, his all-round performances were largely woeful in this edition.</p><p>Given his role as a finisher, it can be unfair to judge him solely on his batting numbers, but even he would struggle to justify his batting performances in this edition.</p><p>His off-spinners have been handy for Scotland in the past but he failed to make any sizable impact in this tournament where some of the other overseas spinners like Will Bosisto and Mohammad Mohsin were able to make a mark.</p><p>Overall, he ended up with middling performances with both bat and ball in this edition.</p><hr><h4 id=9-gulshan-jha-all-rounder-karnali-yaks><strong>9. Gulshan Jha (All-rounder, Karnali Yaks)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 132 runs in 9 innings, Avg 18.85, SR 110.00, HS 49*</li><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 1 wicket in 4 innings, Avg 63.00, Econ 7.87</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 6 dismissals (6 catches)</li></ul><p>Gulshan Jha might be an entry in this list that might surprise some. His batting figures look decent, if not exceptional, and he was sparingly used as a bowler, which was not his fault.</p><p>However, he was easily the most-sought-after domestic player in the auction where every team bid the maximum amount for him. Such hype prior to the tournament would have implied that he would be one of the central figures in the Yaks&rsquo; campaign. However, he largely failed to put in match-winning performances that we are accustomed to seeing from him for the senior national team.</p><p>It was puzzling to see him bat at No. 7 or 8 in a few matches when he is known for his aggressive approach and possesses the advantage of being a left-hander in a tournament dominated by left-arm spinners.</p><p>His limited bowling opportunities were largely due to the fact that the surface at the TU International Cricket Ground was more conducive to spinners and the Yaks had two frontline pacers in the team ahead of him in Nandan Yadav and the skipper Sompal Kami.</p><p>Hence, his entry in this list is more due to him failing to meet his pre-tournament expectations rather than solely based on his performances in the tournament.</p><hr><h4 id=10-sandeep-lamichhane-bowler-biratnagar-kings-marquee><strong>10. Sandeep Lamichhane (Bowler, Biratnagar Kings, marquee)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 6 wickets in 7 innings, Avg 31.83, Econ 6.82</li><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 22 runs in 5 innings, Avg 5.50, SR 110.00</li><li><strong>Fielding:</strong> 1 dismissal (1 catch)</li></ul><p>Sandeep Lamichhane, Nepal’s premier leg-spinner and a marquee player for the Biratnagar Kings, had a below-par season in the NPL 2024/25. He is easily the most prolific wicket-taker in the history of Nepali cricket and was expected to lead the Kings&rsquo; bowling attack and the wicket-taking charts in this edition. However, he continued his recent struggles into the tournament and was wicketless in 4 out of the 7 matches he played.</p><p>While he came back stronger in the latter part of the group stage, his performances were largely underwhelming for a player of his calibre.</p><p>He also possesses a decent batting ability with a knack for clearing the ropes but we didn&rsquo;t see much of that in this edition.</p><hr><h4 id=11-surya-tamang-bowler-lumbini-lions-uncapped><strong>11. Surya Tamang (Bowler, Lumbini Lions, uncapped)</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Bowling:</strong> 1 wicket in 4 innings, Avg 111.00, Econ 7.48</li><li><strong>Batting:</strong> 18 runs in 2 innings, Avg 18.00, SR 94.73</li></ul><p>Surya Tamang had dazzled in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Cup earlier this year ending up as the highest wicket-taker in the tournament. That had led to opportunities for him with the Nepal &lsquo;A&rsquo; squad this year. He was expected to lead the Lions&rsquo; bowling attack in this edition especially in favourable conditions at the TU International Cricket Ground with the majority of batsmen being right-handers.</p><p>However, hardly anyone could have foreseen the kind of tournament he had. In stark contrast to fellow leading left-arm spinners in the tournament, Tamang struggled to make any kind of impact with the ball and was replaced midway through the Lions&rsquo; campaign by the young left-arm spinner Abhishesh Gautam, who was a revelation for the Lions.</p><p>This was a tournament to forget for Tamang and he would be hoping to bounce back stronger in the upcoming tournaments and that these performances don&rsquo;t affect his chances of making it to the national team.</p><hr><h3 id=dishonourable-mentions>(Dis)Honourable Mentions</h3><h4 id=1-aasif-sheikh-janakpur-bolts>1. <strong>Aasif Sheikh (Janakpur Bolts)</strong></h4><p>Despite being a regular for Nepal in each format, Aasif was yet another Nepali opener who struggled to provide solid starts. His sub-100 strike rate and a sub-15 average rate in the tournament say it all. However, his team is now in the final and he might have a chance to redeem himself then.</p><h4 id=2-babar-hayat-karnali-yaks>2. <strong>Babar Hayat (Karnali Yaks)</strong></h4><p>The former Hong Kong captain was expected to provide some fireworks from the top order for the Yaks but he failed consistently in this edition.</p><h4 id=3-dev-khanal-kathmandu-gurkhas>3. <strong>Dev Khanal (Kathmandu Gurkhas)</strong></h4><p>The former U-19 captain would have hoped to make this a coming-of-age tournament for him to make a case for the senior national team but he failed to produce consistent performances. Moreover, his on-field antics meant that his temperament and decision-making were questioned in a few matches.</p><h4 id=4-n-joshi-pokhara-avengers>4. <strong>N Joshi (Pokhara Avengers)</strong></h4><p>A player generally on the rise in the domestic circuit, Joshi would have hoped to showcase his explosive batting in this edition but failed to do so despite getting opportunities.</p><h4 id=5-ranjit-kumar-chitwan-rhinos>5. <strong>Ranjit Kumar (Chitwan Rhinos)</strong></h4><p>In a tournament dominated by left-arm spinners, Ranjit Kumar was expected to perform as an able deputy to the frontline spinners but he failed to make impact, and was targeted by opposition batsmen in multiple matches. His performances ran in contrast to the other spinners from the U-19 squad.</p><h4 id=6-sharad-vesawkar-chitwan-rhinos>6. <strong>Sharad Vesawkar (Chitwan Rhinos)</strong></h4><p>The veteran all-rounder is definitely past his prime but would have been expected to produce some assured performances. His batting displays were largely underwhelming in this edition. Would he feature as a player in the next edition?</p><h4 id=7-aarif-sheikh-sudur-paschim-royals>7. <strong>Aarif Sheikh (Sudur Paschim Royals)</strong></h4><p>Slightly hidden in plain sight between some mesmerizing performances from the Royals has been Aarif Sheikh&rsquo;s mediocre tournament. His first five innings ended in single-digit scores and he has not been relied upon to bowl in this edition. The unbeated 42 against the Avengers is the only innings keeping him from the main list.</p><hr><p>While the above list is subjective and based on my observations, it is important to note that the players mentioned above are all talented cricketers who have had successful careers in the past. The NPL 2024/25 was a tough tournament for many players, particularly batsmen, due to the slow, turning tracks at the TU International Cricket Ground. The pressure of playing in a high-profile tournament with the eyes of the cricketing world on them might have also played a part in their underwhelming performances.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s hoping that these players bounce back stronger in the upcoming tournaments and continue to entertain cricket fans around the world with their skills and performances.</p><p>#NPL2024 #UnderwhelmingXI #CricketAnalysis</p></article><div class="px-2 mb-2"><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo data-repo-id data-category data-category-id data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=preferred_color_scheme data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="container px-4 py-12 mx-auto max-w-4xl grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 items-center"><div><div class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Follow me</div><p class=opacity-60>I write blog posts here and tweet about cricket on X.</p></div><ul class="flex justify-center gap-x-3 flex-wrap gap-y-2"><li><a href=https://twitter.com/cricketpremee target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label=Twitter class="p-1 inline-block rounded-full border border-transparent text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-800 hover:border-gray-800 cursor-pointer transition-colors dark:text-gray-600 dark:hover:border-gray-300 dark:hover:text-gray-300"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M22 4.01c-1 .49-1.98.689-3 .99-1.121-1.265-2.783-1.335-4.38-.737S11.977 6.323 12 8v1c-3.245.083-6.135-1.395-8-4 0 0-4.182 7.433 4 11-1.872 1.247-3.739 2.088-6 2 3.308 1.803 6.913 2.423 10.034 1.517 3.58-1.04 6.522-3.723 7.651-7.742a13.84 13.84.0 00.497-3.753C20.18 7.773 21.692 5.25 22 4.009z"/></svg></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class="container p-6 mx-auto flex justify-between items-center"><span class="text-sm font-light">Copyright © 2024 - Cricket Premee · All rights reserved
