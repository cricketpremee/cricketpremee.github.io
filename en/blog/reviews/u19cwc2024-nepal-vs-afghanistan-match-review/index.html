Here’s a detailed breakdown of the match, player performances, and key moments.</p><p><a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-under-19-world-cup-2023-24-1399722/nepal-under-19s-vs-afghanistan-under-19s-12th-match-group-d-1399735/full-scorecard target=_blank rel=noopener>Here is the scorecard for the match from ESPN Cricinfo.</a></p><h2 id=early-thoughts>Early Thoughts</h2><ul><li>Afghanistan won the toss and elected to bat first.</li><li>Nepal began their bowling innings with great intensity, highlighted by Akash Chand’s fiery opening spell which left Afghanistan reeling at 35/5.</li><li>Afghanistan’s lower order, particularly Ghazanfar, Naseer Khan, and Fareed Dawoodzai, counterattacked effectively, stabilizing their innings after early setbacks.</li></ul><h2 id=match-summary>Match Summary</h2><p>Nepal put in a commendable effort to keep Afghanistan under pressure throughout the game. However, the Afghan lower order showcased resilience, putting up a strong partnership for the ninth wicket. Nepal’s chase faltered with quick wickets early on, and despite some promising starts, they couldn’t build a sustained innings to reach the target. However, a captain’s knock from Dev Khanal and another resilient showing from the lower-order helped Nepal over the line with a scrappy but memorable win. They are into the Super Sixes with the win.</p><h2 id=player-ratings>Player Ratings</h2><h3 id=bipin-rawal-310><strong>Bipin Rawal (3/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Safe hands for the Taniwal’s edge off Chand’s bowling to bring about the second wicket in the second over.</li><li>But a couple of fumbles when the early pacers were bowling. Dropped a chance off Chand’s bowling that would have carried to first slip.</li><li>Watchful batting against Ghazanfar. But could not get going against the other bowler as well. Trapped in front by a superb yorker from Khalil Ahmed. Departs for 2 leaving Nepal in early trouble.</li></ul><h3 id=arjun-kumal-410><strong>Arjun Kumal (4/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Made some excellent stops in the field and almost effected a run-out.</li><li>Looked calm and composed early on and played a couple of decent shots for four.</li><li>Got out, bowled on 10 as he chopped the ball onto his stumps. Could not provide the assured start that Nepal were hoping for and gave Afg an early opening.</li></ul><h3 id=gulshan-jha-410><strong>Gulshan Jha (4/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Gets a wicket in the first over to get Nepal up and running.</li><li>Hattrick of wides in his sixth consecutive overs. Looked a little tired by the end of his spell.</li><li>Consistently keeps bowling effort balls but has been slightly unlucky this tournament.</li><li>Came in at #3 to take charge of the batting innings. Got a free-hit on his third ball of the innings but failed to make contact.</li><li>Creamed a couple of shots straight to the point fielder. Got bowled with a peach of an inswinging delivery on the third ball of Ahmad&rsquo;s over.</li><li>Hard to have done much more against a great delivery.</li><li>The move to bring him up the order fails for Nepal, leaving them 15/2.</li><li>While the move failed this time, it holds promise for a long Gulshan-Dev partnership in the Super Sixes.</li></ul><h3 id=dev-khanal-8510><strong>Dev Khanal (8.5/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Safe hands for a couple of catches and was spot-on with his bowling changes.</li><li>Creamed the first ball he faced to the offside for four runs.</li><li>Almost got out the first delivery he faced from Ghazanfar. Dropped by Ghazanfar off his bowling to let him off on 4.</li><li>Capitalized on the let-off and looked to build a long innings. More reserved approach than in previous games, apt for the game situation. Rotated strike well, and scored the odd boundaries.</li><li>Was very vocal with his communication, offering encouragement to Aakash when he batted during the 49-run partnership. Showed his determination.</li><li>Flurry of wickets increased pressure on Dev but he got to his fifty with a four off Ghazanfar.</li><li>Looked like he would get the team home but was undone by a peach of a wrongun from Ghazanfar that kissed the outside edge of his bat and was gobbled by the keeper.</li><li>Nervously watched on from the dugout as the tailenders strived to win the game for the team.</li><li>Played a true captain&rsquo;s knock that will live long in the memory of Nepal fans.</li><li>Getting the team home with his bat was the icing on the cake that was not to be.</li></ul><h3 id=aakash-tripathi-5510><strong>Aakash Tripathi (5.5/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Great diving stop early in the fielding innings. Did not (need to) bowl today.</li><li>Came in at #5 with Nepal in early trouble at 24/3. Watchful start. Rotated the strike decently against spinners.</li><li>Did well to stay with Dev for a 49-run partnership. Got out against the run of play hitting one straight to the cover fielder.</li><li>Important member of the team and a trusted top-order batter, but has lost his wickets early or cheaply all tournament.</li></ul><h3 id=deepak-dumre-310><strong>Deepak Dumre (3/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Safe hands for the skier to bring the first wicket.</li><li>Came in after a big partnership, at #6, but looked at sea against the legspinner from the start.</li><li>Got lucky a couple of times but eventually edged a sharp catch to slip on 5.</li></ul><h3 id=dipesh-kandel-610><strong>Dipesh Kandel (6/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Introduced late in the twenty-first over due to the long spells of seamers. Struck fourth ball to trap Momand lbw.</li><li>Broke the crucial ninth wicket partnership with a clever change of angle to dismiss the opposition captain, caught and bowled.</li><li>Came in to bat at #7, and smacked a ball for four over mid-on to provide some counterattacking impetus.</li><li>Then got trapped in front trying to play square of the wicket on the on-side against a straight full one on the stumps.</li></ul><h3 id=dipak-bohara-6510><strong>Dipak Bohara (6.5/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Came in lower than usual at #8 after a flurry of wickets, and looked to punish any bad balls from the spinners.</li><li>Scored counterattacking fours straight down the ground, over midwicket, and with an edge past the first slip early on.</li><li>Built a 36-run partnership with Dev to edge Nepal in front.</li><li>Was building a decent partnership with Subash when he got done all ends up by a slower yorker from Dawoodzai.</li><li>Second highest score with the bat for the Nepal innings oulines his contribution to the win.</li></ul><h3 id=subash-bhandari-810><strong>Subash Bhandari (8/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Accurate & economical with the ball, hard to put away but did not cause huge problems for the batsmen.</li><li>Wrapped up the bowling innings with the final wicket. Enticed the batsman with a wider, fuller ball that was skied towards mid-off and caught by Dev.</li><li>So so assured with the bat that it is unbelievable that he bats down at #9.</li><li>Absorbs the batting pressure and hits the winning runs for the team.</li><li>Yet again at the centre when Nepal finish their batting innings.</li></ul><h3 id=akash-chand-9510><strong>Akash Chand (9.5/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>What a bowling performance from him again!</li><li>Strikes first over to take the outside edge of the bat to build on Gulshan’s great start.</li><li>Found some swing early on, bowled full and fast, and reaped rewards. Consistently at the batsmen.</li><li>What an opening spell that got him a fifer with no batsmen able to get on top of him. Bowled seven overs on the fly.</li><li>From his aggression to his celebrations, he has been wonderful to watch this tournament.</li><li>Outstanding opening spell, taking a fifer with consistent swing and pace.<ul><li>1st wicket: caught by the keeper.</li><li>2nd wicket: bowled.</li><li>3rd wicket: chipped to mid-on.</li><li>4th wicket: LBW.</li><li>5th wicket: chipped to mid-off.</li></ul></li><li>Has batted well this tournament but got done by a deceptive slower ball from Dawoodzai.</li><li>Hitting the winning runs for the team would have completed his fairytale outing but was not to be.</li></ul><h3 id=tilak-raj-bhandari-510><strong>Tilak Raj Bhandari (5/10)</strong></h3><ul><li>Called in to bowl to neutralize the Ghazanfar batting threat. Instead welcomed with a mammoth six. Then conceded a streaky, edged four.</li><li>But got his man with the third ball that he bowled away from the batsman who slashes a looping catch to the point fielder.</li><li>Provides the edge that legspinners usually do with the ball.</li><li>That Buddha celebration after dismissing Ghazanfar will surely make some headlines.</li><li>Had to come in to bat at #11, but solely to watch from the non-strikers end as Subash hit the winning runs.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=key-takeaways-from-nep-vs-afg>Key Takeaways from NEP vs AFG</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Bowling Brilliance</strong>: Nepal’s bowlers showcased exceptional performances, particularly Akash Chand, who secured a five-wicket haul with his lethal swing and disciplined line and length. Gulshan Jha, Dipesh Kandel, and Subash Bhandari also contributed significantly to restricting Afghanistan&rsquo;s batting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Catching and Fielding</strong>: Improved fielding performance was evident, though a couple of missed opportunities highlighted areas for continued focus. Notable contributions from players like Deepak Dumre and Subash Bhandari added to the overall effort.</p></li><li><p><strong>Captain’s Knock</strong>: Dev Khanal’s leadership shone through with a composed innings under pressure, guiding Nepal to a hard-fought victory. His tactical acumen and batting prowess were instrumental in securing the win.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finally Some Middle-Order Resilience</strong>: Dev Khanal held the innings together with a determined half-century, supported by Aakash Tripathi and Dipak Bohara, who played crucial roles in steadying the innings and constructing the chase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subash Bhandari’s Consistency</strong>: Subash Bhandari’s all-round performance was a standout, showcasing his ability to hold up an end with the ball while also providing crucial runs in the lower order to see Nepal through to victory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Areas for Improvement</strong>: Better execution in rotating the strike during middle overs and handling pressure situations with composure are key areas for Nepal to address moving forward.</p></li></ul></article><div class="px-2 mb-2"><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo data-repo-id data-category data-category-id data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=preferred_color_scheme data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-gray-900"><div class="container px-4 py-12 mx-auto max-w-4xl grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 items-center"><div><div class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Follow me</div><p class=opacity-60>I write blog posts here and tweet about cricket on X.</p></div><ul class="flex justify-center gap-x-3 flex-wrap gap-y-2"><li><a href=https://twitter.com/cricketpremee target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label=Twitter class="p-1 inline-block rounded-full border border-transparent text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-800 hover:border-gray-800 cursor-pointer transition-colors dark:text-gray-600 dark:hover:border-gray-300 dark:hover:text-gray-300"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M22 4.01c-1 .49-1.98.689-3 .99-1.121-1.265-2.783-1.335-4.38-.737S11.977 6.323 12 8v1c-3.245.083-6.135-1.395-8-4 0 0-4.182 7.433 4 11-1.872 1.247-3.739 2.088-6 2 3.308 1.803 6.913 2.423 10.034 1.517 3.58-1.04 6.522-3.723 7.651-7.742a13.84 13.84.0 00.497-3.753C20.18 7.773 21.692 5.25 22 4.009z"/></svg></a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class="container p-6 mx-auto flex justify-between items-center"><span class="text-sm font-light">Copyright © 2024 - Cricket Premee · All rights reserved
