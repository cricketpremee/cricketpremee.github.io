After much deliberation, hereâ€™s our &lt;strong>Best Overall XI&lt;/strong>, featuring players who excelled with their consistent displays throughout the tournament.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Key criteria&lt;/strong> for selection:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A fieldable team with a good ratio of batsmen, bowlers, , all-rounders, and a wicketkeeper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No restrictions on the number of overseas players (check out &lt;a href="#best-fieldable-xi-of-npl-202425">the Best Fieldable XI&lt;/a>
 for the best XI team with 4 overseas players).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="overall-best-xi">Overall Best XI&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="1-lahiru-milantha-openerwicketkeeper-janakpur-bolts-overseas">&lt;strong>1. Lahiru Milantha (Opener/Wicketkeeper, Janakpur Bolts, overseas)&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Batting:&lt;/strong> 293 runs in 10 innings, Avg 32.55, SR 130.80, HS 87&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Milantha ended the tournament as the top run scorer but his path through the tournament had peaks and troughs. He started the tournament with a bang, scoring an unbeaten 75 against the Kings. His performances trended downwards after that but he came back strong in the final with a match-winning 87 off 49 balls. As such, he narrowly edges out Andries Gous for the opener&amp;rsquo;s spot in this Best XI with the weight of his performances in the final for a winning cause for the Bolts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
