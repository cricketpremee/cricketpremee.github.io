&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Afghanistan won the toss and elected to bat first.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nepal began their bowling innings with great intensity, highlighted by Akash Chand’s fiery opening spell which left Afghanistan reeling at 35/5.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="match-summary">Match Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Nepal put in a commendable effort to keep Afghanistan under pressure throughout the game. However, the Afghan lower order showcased resilience, putting up a strong partnership for the ninth wicket. Nepal’s chase faltered with quick wickets early on, and despite some promising starts, they couldn’t build a sustained innings to reach the target. However, a captain’s knock from Dev Khanal and another resilient showing from the lower-order helped Nepal over the line with a scrappy but memorable win. They are into the Super Sixes with the win.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NEP vs PAK: U19 Cricket World Cup 2024 - Match Review</title><link>https://cricketpremee.github.io/en/blog/reviews/u19cwc2024-nepal-vs-pakistan-match-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 02:56:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://cricketpremee.github.io/en/blog/reviews/u19cwc2024-nepal-vs-pakistan-match-review/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="nep-vs-pak-u19-cricket-world-cup-2024---match-review">NEP vs PAK: U19 Cricket World Cup 2024 - Match Review&lt;/h1>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Team Composition Issues:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nepal fielded too few seamers, forcing them to rely on part-timer Aakash Tripathi during crucial stages. While Tripathi bowled decently, this highlighted the need for a third frontline seamer given the nature of the pitch and the game conditions.&lt;/li>
