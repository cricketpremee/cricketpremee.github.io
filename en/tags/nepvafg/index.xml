&lt;h2 id="match-summary">Match Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Nepal put in a commendable effort to keep Afghanistan under pressure throughout the game. However, the Afghan lower order showcased resilience, putting up a strong partnership for the ninth wicket. Nepal’s chase faltered with quick wickets early on, and despite some promising starts, they couldn’t build a sustained innings to reach the target. However, a captain’s knock from Dev Khanal and another resilient showing from the lower-order helped Nepal over the line with a scrappy but memorable win. They are into the Super Sixes with the win.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
