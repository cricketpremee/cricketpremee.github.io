&lt;p>&lt;strong>Key criteria&lt;/strong> for selection of this 11 include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A team with 4 overseas picks, at least 1 uncapped player, at least 1 marquee player, and a fieldable mix of bowlers, wicketkeeper, and batsmen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Underwhelming does not mean a list of worst performers, but rather players who failed to meet expectations or deliver on their potential.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="underwhelming-xi">Underwhelming XI&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="1-aashutosh-ghiraiya-opener-lumbini-lions-uncapped">&lt;strong>1. Aashutosh Ghiraiya (Opener, Lumbini Lions, uncapped)&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Batting:&lt;/strong> 44 runs in 6 innings, Avg 7.33, SR 62.85, HS 16&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aashutosh Ghiraiya had a tough campaign for the Lumbini Lions in the NPL 2024/25. Known for his stellar domestic performances, especially in the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s Cup earlier this year, Ghiraiya struggled to find any kind of form in this tournament. His inability to provide solid starts as an opener left the Lions in a precarious position early in their innings. This disappointing performance was a far cry from the expectations set by the teams during the player draft as he was sold for the highest price for Category B players.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
